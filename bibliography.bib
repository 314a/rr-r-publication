abstract = {R is a powerful open source computing tool that supports geographical analysis and mapping for the many geography and ‘non-geography' students and researchers interested in spatial analysis and mapping. This book provides an introduction to the use of R for spatial statistical analysis, geocomputation and the analysis of geographical information for researchers collecting and using data with location attached, largely through increased GPS functionality. Brunsdon and Comber take readers from ‘zero to hero' in spatial analysis and mapping through functions they have developed and compiled into R packages. This enables practical R applications in GIS, spatial analyses, spatial statistics, mapping, and web-scraping. Each chapter includes: Example data and commands for exploring it Scripts and coding to exemplify specific functionality Advice for developing greater understanding - through functions such as locator(), View(), and alternative coding to achieve the same ends Self-contained exercises for students to work through Embedded code within the descriptive text. This is a definitive 'how to' that takes students - of any discipline - from coding to actual applications and uses of R.},

abstract = {Reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific research, because the credibility of science is at stake when research is not reproducible. Like science, the development of good, reliable scientific software is a social process. A mature and growing community relies on the R software environment for carrying out geoscientific research. Here we describe why people use R and how it helps in communicating and reproducing research. R is a multiplatform open-source software environment R Development Core Team, 2012 that implements S, a language designed for data analysis. It provides low-level routines for data management tasks and linear algebra and high-level routines for fitting statistical models or creating complex graphs. The R engine is being developed by a small team called R core. R is extensible, and a set of more than 3500 add-on packages are being actively maintained by a similar number of developers.},

Versions are provided for Macintosh, UNIX and Windows machines. Wavelab makes available, in one package, all the code to reproduce all the figures in our published wavelet articles. The interested reader can inspect the source code to see exactly what algorithms were used, how parameters were set in producing our figures, and can then modify the source to produce variations on our results. WAVELAB has been developed, in part, because of exhortations by Jon Claerbout of Stanford that computational scientists should engage in “really reproducible” research.},

@article{Healy2011,
abstract = {I do think, however, that if you're in the early phase of your career as a graduate student in, say, Sociology, or Economics, or Political Science, you should give some thought to how you're going to organize and manage your work. This is so for two reasons. First, the transition to graduate school is a good time to make changes. Early on, there's less inertia and cost associated with switching things around than there will be later. Second, in the social sciences, text and data management skills are usually not taught to students explicitly. This means that you may end up adopting the practices of your advisor or mentor, continue to use what you are taught in your methods classes, or just copy whatever your peers are doing. Following these paths may lead you to an arrangement that you will be happy with. But maybe not. It's worth looking at the options.},

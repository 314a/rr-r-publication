  \npublications in R with R Markdown and the help of some packages.  Based on a \nconcrete

## Introduction 

This example publication is aimed to serve as a motivation on how to create reproducible documents in R and to advocate in general reproducible research.

## State of the Art

Various authors in qualitative and quantitive research argue for that as many parts of the research workflow reproducible. @Brunsdon2015 state "Reproducible quantitative research is research that has been documented sufficiently rigorously that a third party can replicate any quantitative results that arise". 

To further motivate you, read [@Healy2016,@Leveque2012,@Baker2016,@Nature2016,@Pebesma2012,@Vandewalle2012,@Nuest2011,@Buckheit1995,@Healy2011] or the short and to the point editorial of @Nature2016.

## R Markdown

### Plots (include figures)

```{r readGoogleTrend}
# https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=parc%20adula
d <- read.csv(file.path(dataFolder,"google_trend.csv"),sep=",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,skip = 2)
names(d)<- c("Month","Count")
d$Month <- as.Date(paste(d$Month,"-01",sep=""))
# keep only the queries after March 2007, seems that before the counting is weird..
d<-d[d$Month>as.Date("2007-03-01"),]
```

```{r googleTrend,fig.height=2,fig.width=5,fig.cap="Timeline of queries for Parc Adula set in the Google search engine"}
ggplot( d, aes(Month, Count)) + geom_line() +labs(list(x = "", y = "Monthly Queries", title ="Google Trend queries for 'Parc Adula'"))+theme_bw()
```

Example to generate and load created image from figure folder

```{r map,fig.width=6, out.width = "80%",fig.cap="Plot of the cars data set"}
plotPng <- file.path(figureFolder,"plot.png")
if(!file.exists(plotPng)){
png(filename=plotPng,width = 800,height=550,res=72)
plot.new()
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0), oma=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(cars)
dev.off()
}else{knitr::include_graphics(plotPng)}
```

### Data tables

```{r read}
d <- read.csv(file.path(dataFolder,"interview_data.csv"),sep=";",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(d) <- gsub("[.]"," ", names(d))
d <- cbind(d[,1:4],d[ , order(names(d[,5:ncol(d)]),decreasing = TRUE)+4]) # column order hack
d <- ddply(d, .(ParentCode), numcolwise(sum)) # summarise variable
d.m <- melt(d)
```

```{r tableTopics}
ds <-data.frame(Code=d$ParentCode,Mention=rowSums(d[,2:ncol(d)]))
knitr::kable(ds, caption = "Topic mentions.")
```


## Discussion and Conclusion

This template based on data of an ongoing research project presents some typical examples maybe used in a publication writen in RMarkdown. It presents the inclusion of data and analysis, features plots, tables, and various markdown elements and shows how to integrate literature. The generated files in _PDF_, _Word_ or _HTML_ often still need fine some fine-tuning afterwards (particularly in Latex). However, it still presents a great way documenting the research process, that is easily shareable and the generation of the initial drafts.
